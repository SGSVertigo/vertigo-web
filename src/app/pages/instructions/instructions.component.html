<h3>LEDs (Lights)</h3>
<p>Vertigo has a set of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) which indicate information about the current status of Vertigo.
    There are three LEDs on the device. These are Green, Orange and Blue in colour.</p>

<h3>Turning vertigo on</h3>
<p>Vertigo has a slide switch on the side of the case which turns it on. Slide it towards the front of the unit to turn
    on. The unit will flash a green led on the top when it is turned on and hasn't got a GPS position.

    If plugged in to usb, the switch selects whether Vertigo is powered by USB or Battery.</p>

<h3>Starting and stopping logging.</h3>
<p>Before starting logging, make sure that and SD card has been inserted and, if GPS is needed for the experiment, that
    a GPS position has been found. Vertigo will stop flashing the green LED once it has found it's GPS position and the
    green light will stay on solid green.</p>

<h3>Clear and format SD Card</h3>
<h3>Formatting</h3>

<p>Before Vertigo can use the SD card, it must be formatted correctly to be used. Vertigo comes with an SD card, however
    if it is in the wrong format or you are using a different SD card, you need to format it as FAT32 or exFAT. Follow
    the instructions here to format it:

</p>
<h3>Clearing</h3>
<p>Once formatted, Vertigo will write calibration and default configuration files to the SD card. If you want to remove
    any old log files from the SD card, or if you run out of space. Follow the instrutions below to clear the SD card:
</p>
<p>Whilst vertigo is turned off, press and hold the log button. Turn on vertigo whilst continuing to hold down the
    button. The orange LED will flash rapidly whilst the SD card is clearing.</p>

<h3>Inserting and removing SD cards</h3>
<p>The SD card slot it spring loaded, to insert an SD card, push it until you hear a click and then release. To remove
    the SD card, use something to push it again until it clicks and then release, the SD card should spring out far
    enough to pull out.</p>
