<p>This activity requires the software package matlab. Please ensure your pupils have access to this programme and the relevant scripts highlighted below.
It is advisable that teachers familiarise themselves with the process before delivering the lesson content to a class.</p>
<h1 id="safety">Safety</h1>
<p>appropriate risk assessment should be made in compliance with departmental requirements</p>

<h1 id="data-acquisition">Data acquisition</h1>
<ul>
<li>Making sure the Vertigo unit is fully charged, take the class to a suitable outdoor area to record your data.</li>
<li>Turn the unit on and wait for the second LED to stop flashing. This means that Vertigo has a GPS signal. It may take a minute.</li>
<li>Select a pupil to run with Vertigo.</li>
<li>
<p>Request that the pupil carries the device like an athlete carrying the
Olympic torch. (This is not strictly necessary but, with more wobbling around,
Vertigo may miss a GPS point. This would make analysis far trickier
– and is not conducive to good lesson outcomes).</p>
<p><img src="https://vertigo.engineering/vertigo-instructions/Olympic_runner.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</li>
<li>Press the Log button (a solid LED light come on) and set the pupil off on a pre-determined route.</li>
</ul>
<p>On their return, press Vertigo’s log button again. The solid LED light starts to flash. When it stops flashing, Vertigo may be turned off; the data is ready to be analysed.</p>
<p>If <a name="DataS"></a>data acquisition fails, sample data is available for this activity <a href="/vertigo-instructions/Sprint_data.csv">here</a></p>
<h1 id="data-analysis">Data analysis</h1>
<p>The following files should be emailed (or otherwise given to the pupils) before the lesson. (Show my homework or similar may be of help here) The files need to be used by the pupils from a directory of their own. Else, any modifications the pupils might make would be apparent to all.</p>
<p>These can all be found <a href="/vertigo-instructions/Ks3_Lesson_link.zip">here</a></p>
<p>Ask the pupils to download them to a non-shared drive.</p>
<p>Ask the pupils to open matlab and, using the top left icon, open the file “Load_up_your data”
In the meantime, the csv file created will need to be accessed by the pupils. This should be added to a public drive or emailed to the pupils.</p>
<p>Pupils should execute this script by using the run button, top centre of the screen. They will be prompted to open a file. This file should be the one recorded in the lesson.
After a short time, a graph similar to the one below, should appear:</p>
<p><img src="https://vertigo.engineering/vertigo-instructions/Accelerations.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the graphs above, it can be noted, that the pupil started to run at 3 seconds and stopped at about 28 seconds.</p>
<p>This information is important.</p>
<p>In the command window, located at the bottom of the screen, pupils will be asked,
“What time do you wish to start analysis from?”
Pupils should enter a time in this window and hit the enter key. For the example above, they might add 3, and press enter.
They will then be asked,
“What time do you wish to end the analysis?”</p>
<p>28 seconds would be a reasonable time to end.</p>
<p>The programme will then perform its analysis. This may take a moment.</p>
<p>Eventually, matlab will produce a graph similar to the one below:</p>
<p><img src="https://vertigo.engineering/vertigo-instructions/Running_in_the_yard.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>On the ‘figure’ screen, under the desktop ‘tab’ is the data-cursor icon.</p>
<p><img src="https://vertigo.engineering/vertigo-instructions/cursor.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Pupils can click this to add a cursor point the graph’s curve. This will give them ‘x and y’ coordinates. In this case, Time and Displacement or Velocity.
Multiple cursor points can be added by holding shift and re-clicking.</p>
<p>The shape of the graphs can be discussed with the pupils. They can then answer the questions on the reverse of ‘The Physics of sprinting’.</p>
<h2 id="intermediate"><a name="IntermediateS"></a>Intermediate</h2>
<p>Go back to the file and to lines 399 to 411.
These have been commented out but can be revived by clicking the green %x symbol at the top of the screen. Some lines will remain green – this is intentional.</p>
<p>Running the script again will give the pupils a quiver plot of the pupil’s velocity through time. See if the pupils can work out what they’re looking at and ask them to label the axes.</p>
<p>This is an excellent time to initiate a discussion on vectors.</p>
<h2 id="advanced"><a name="AdvancedS"></a>Advanced</h2>
<h1 id="gradients">Gradients</h1>
<p>Closing the most recent quiver plot students should open the file:</p>
<p>Getslopeintercept.m</p>
<p>This will open the most recent figure and ask the user to click on the graph. The pupils will be able to draw a tangent to the displacement/ time curve.
The programme will then generate a value for the gradient.
Using cursors as before, the pupils will be able to verify that the gradient of the distance time graph is the velocity at that instant. (This is useful as it highlights positive and negative gradients).</p>
<p><img src="https://vertigo.engineering/vertigo-instructions/Gradients.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>It is also possible, by de-commenting lines 386 – 390, to view the acceleration against/ time.</p>

<p>It is likely that pupils will want to compare their V/t graphs… Welcome to the Vertigo project.</p>
